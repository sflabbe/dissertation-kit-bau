\chapter*{Abstract}

This work addresses the development of novel optimization methods for complex systems. The investigated approaches enable efficient solutions for problems in various application areas.

The developed model is based on a mathematical approach that considers several aspects. The following elements are investigated:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Discretization of the system
	\item Modeling of boundary conditions
	\item Consideration of nonlinear effects
	\item Influence of different parameters
	\item Effects of different configurations
\end{itemize}

The validation of the model is performed by comparison with experimental data. The results show good agreement between simulation and measurement.

The developed model enables efficient prediction of expected results and can serve as a basis for further investigations. The computational efficiency allows the execution of extensive parameter studies.

Furthermore, the model provides insights into the mechanisms of the studied phenomena. This understanding is essential for developing improved methodologies and for assessing the applicability under various conditions.
